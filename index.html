					<h2>About Me</h2>
	<div class="container"> 
		<p> I'm the kind of person who walks into a room and quietly notices the little things others miss, like a plant that needs water or a joke waiting to be made. I balance curiosity with a laid-back vibe, always ready to try something new but never rushing into anything without a moment of thought. People find it easy to talk to me because I listen with genuine interest, and even though I don’t always show it. Whether exploring a new hobby, getting lost in music, or just chilling with my own thoughts, I carry a mix of calm confidence and quiet determination that makes my presence feel steady and real.</p>
